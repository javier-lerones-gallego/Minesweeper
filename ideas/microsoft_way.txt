The MS way, the squares are created and the mouse clicks are assigned, but the bombs are not placed in the board until the first click.

So:

	CREATE the js board object
		CREATE the square objects
		ATTACH click events to the squares
		FIND and ASSIGN neighbouring squares
	WAIT for first left mouse click
		RANDOMIZE mines in any squares except the one clicked
		CALCULATE new neighbouring mines counts
		REVEAL the square that was clicked
	START the game

Notes:
	1. Create the js board object, it needs to be created with the determined number of squares, and also the HTML element for each square needs to be created too.
	2. Create the square objects, they also need to be created properly, however they won't have a bomb count, or they all be 0 until the first click
	3. Click events are attached normally, however:
		3.1 the left mouse event click checks for 'first click' flag each time.
		3.2 the double click doesn't work until the game starts, so check for first click each time too.
	4. Assign neighbouring squares works the same, even calculating the mine number, all will be 0 because there are no mines yet.
	5. Randomize function takes an extra param, the index to avoid.
	6. Refresh the mine count after the mines are placed.
